Please refer to user guide located in section B of the appendix of my report. The user guide contain instructions on setup and how to run the application as well as instructions on how to use the application.

The junit test classes are located in the src/application/testing directory. To run these test classes you can do it by command line or via an IDE such as Eclipse or Intellij. Please refer to this guide on how to run tests through command line: https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#running-tests-console-launcher. To run the test cases through the eclipse IDE please refer to: http://www.eclipseonetips.com/2014/06/16/run-a-single-junit-test-method-in-eclipse/.
